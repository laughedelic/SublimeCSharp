# C# Sublime Text plugin

This is a fork of the C# language TextMate bundle, which is intended to adapt and improve it for Sublime Text 2. Main, and meanwhile the only, feature is _corrected Symbol List_ definitions — inner symbols are shown with _indentation_.

**Note**: I don't use C# or TextMate. Just made it for my friend. So, feel free to fork it and continue improvements.

## Installation

[Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) is better, because it will automatically update plugin and you can delete it or temporarily disable through it.

### Install with Package Control

* `⌘⇧P` ➤ `Package Control: Add Repository`, paste `https://github.com/laughedelic/SublimeCSharp`;
* `⌘⇧P` ➤ `Package Control: Install package` ➤ `SublimeCSharp`;

### Install with Git

To install, open your Sublime `Packages/` folder and run

    git clone https://github.com/laughedelic/SublimeCSharp

to update, just use `git pull`.
